</br>
A DoS attack that disconnects all devices from a target wifi network.
* The network's password is not required
* Tested on Kali NetHunter


**IMPORTANT** </br>
Rarely some network APs operate on both 5GHz (`channel > 14`) and 2.4GHz (`channel < 14`) under the same BSSID name. <br>In order to truly bring the AP down, I usually run simultaneously two processes with 2 separate network interfaces, one for 2.4GHz and one for 5GHz.
## How it works

This program iterates over all possible channels, and by sniffing `802.11` packets it determines which access points are available. </br>
After the attacker chooses a target access point to attack, the program:
1. Continously sends spoofed deauthentication packets using broadcast mac address as the destination
2. Starts sniffing for clients that are connected to the AP by filtering for certain 802.11 packet frames and sending spoofed deauthentication packets to those clients as well


# Usage
```bash
python3 wifi-deauth.py -i <iface>
```
### Usage notes
*  `<iface>` is the name of the network interface (i.e `wlan0` or `eth0`) that supports packet injection
* Pass `--kill` (or run `sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager`) in order to kill NetworkManager service which might interfere with the attack
* The initial iteration over all channels might take a minute or two (depends on how many bands the interface supports)
* Pass `--skip-monitormode` if you want to enable monitor mode manually (otherwise the program does it automatically)

### Misc notes
* Check `ifconfig` to find the interface nickname
* Works for 2.4GHhz and 5Ghz
* Beware that some access points have protections against this kind of attack and therefore it might not work on them

### Requirements
* Linux OS
* A network adapter that supports monitor mode and packet injection
* Scapy library (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Deadnet
There's [another method](https://github.com/flashnuke/deadnet) to perform a DoS attack on networks, which requires credentials but quite effective.
